# Read Episode
## Values and Variables
We’ll kick off this module with a little code snippet.
```
let reaction = 'yikes';
reaction[0] = 'l';
console.log(reaction);
```
What do you expect this code to do? It’s okay if you’re not sure. **Try to find the answer using your current knowledge of JavaScript.**

I want you to take a few moments and write down your exact thought process for each line of this code, step by step. Pay attention to any gaps or uncertainties in your existing mental model and write them down, too. If you have any doubts, try to articulate them as clearly as you can.

**Answer**

This code will either print "yikes" or throw an error depending on whether you are in strict mode. It will never print "likes".

Yikes.

## Primitive Values Are Immutable
Did you get the answer right? This might seem like the kind of trivia question that only comes up in JavaScript interviews. Even so, it illustrates an important point about primitive values.

**We can’t change primitive values.**

I will explain this with a small example. Strings (which are primitive) and arrays (which are not) have some superficial similarities. An array is a sequence of items, and a string is a sequence of characters:
```
let arr = [212, 8, 506];
let str = 'hello';
```
We can access the array’s first item and the string’s first character similarly. It almost feels like strings are arrays:
```
console.log(arr[0]); // 212
console.log(str[0]); // "h"
```
But they’re not. Let’s take a closer look. We can change an array’s first item:
```
arr[0] = 420;
console.log(arr); // [420, 8, 506]
```
Intuitively, it’s easy to assume that we can do the same to a string:
```
str[0] = 'j'; // ???
```
**But we can’t.**

It’s an important detail we need to add to our mental model. A string is a primitive value, and **all primitive values are immutable.** “Immutable” is a fancy Latin way to say “unchangeable.” Read-only. We can’t mess with primitive values. At all.

JavaScript won’t let us set a property on any primitive value, be it a number, string or something else. Whether it will silently refuse our request or throw an error depends on [which mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) our code is in. But rest assured that this will never work:
```
let fifty = 50;
fifty.shades = 'gray'; // No!
```
Like any number, 50 is a primitive value. We can’t set properties on it.

Remember that in our JavaScript universe, all primitive values are distant stars, floating farthest from our code. We can point to them, but they will always stay where they are, unchanged.

I find it strangely comforting.
