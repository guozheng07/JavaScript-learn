# Read Episode
## Values and Variables
We’ll kick off this module with a little code snippet.
```
let reaction = 'yikes';
reaction[0] = 'l';
console.log(reaction);
```
What do you expect this code to do? It’s okay if you’re not sure. **Try to find the answer using your current knowledge of JavaScript.**

I want you to take a few moments and write down your exact thought process for each line of this code, step by step. Pay attention to any gaps or uncertainties in your existing mental model and write them down, too. If you have any doubts, try to articulate them as clearly as you can.

**Answer**

This code will either print "yikes" or throw an error depending on whether you are in strict mode. It will never print "likes".

Yikes.

## Primitive Values Are Immutable
Did you get the answer right? This might seem like the kind of trivia question that only comes up in JavaScript interviews. Even so, it illustrates an important point about primitive values.

**We can’t change primitive values.**

I will explain this with a small example. Strings (which are primitive) and arrays (which are not) have some superficial similarities. An array is a sequence of items, and a string is a sequence of characters:
```
let arr = [212, 8, 506];
let str = 'hello';
```
We can access the array’s first item and the string’s first character similarly. It almost feels like strings are arrays:
```
console.log(arr[0]); // 212
console.log(str[0]); // "h"
```
But they’re not. Let’s take a closer look. We can change an array’s first item:
```
arr[0] = 420;
console.log(arr); // [420, 8, 506]
```
Intuitively, it’s easy to assume that we can do the same to a string:
```
str[0] = 'j'; // ???
```
**But we can’t.**

It’s an important detail we need to add to our mental model. A string is a primitive value, and **all primitive values are immutable.** “Immutable” is a fancy Latin way to say “unchangeable.” Read-only. We can’t mess with primitive values. At all.

JavaScript won’t let us set a property on any primitive value, be it a number, string or something else. Whether it will silently refuse our request or throw an error depends on [which mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) our code is in. But rest assured that this will never work:
```
let fifty = 50;
fifty.shades = 'gray'; // No!
```
Like any number, 50 is a primitive value. We can’t set properties on it.

Remember that in our JavaScript universe, all primitive values are distant stars, floating farthest from our code. We can point to them, but they will always stay where they are, unchanged.

I find it strangely comforting.

## Variables and Values—A Contradiction?
You’ve seen that primitive values are read-only—or, in the parlance of our times, immutable. Now, use the following code snippet to test your mental model.
```
let pet = 'Narwhal';
pet = 'The Kraken';
console.log(pet); // ?
```
Like before, write down your thought process in a few sentences. Don’t rush ahead. Pay close attention to how you’re thinking about each line, step by step. Does the immutability of strings play a role here? If it does, what role does it play?

**Answer**

If you thought I was trying to mess with your head, you were right! The answer is "The Kraken". Immutability doesn’t play a role here.

Don’t despair if you got it wrong! This example may seem like it’s contradicting string immutability, but it’s not.

When you’re new to a language, sometimes it’s necessary to put aside contradictions so that you can avoid rabbit holes and continue learning. But now that you are committed to building a mental model, you need to question contradictions.

Contradictions reveal gaps in mental models.

## Variables Are Wires
Let’s look at this example again.
```
let pet = 'Narwhal';
pet = 'The Kraken';
console.log(pet); // "The Kraken"
```
We know that string values can’t change because they are primitive. But the pet variable does change to "The Kraken". What’s up with that?

This might seem like it’s a contradiction, but it’s not. We said primitive values can’t change, but we didn’t say anything about variables! As we refine our mental model, we need to untangle a couple of related concepts:

**Variables are not values.**

**Variables point to values.**

### Assigning a Value to a Variable
In our JavaScript universe, a variable is a wire that points to a value.

For example, I can point the pet variable to the "Narwhal" value. (I can also say that I’m assigning the value "Narwhal" to the variable called pet):
```
let pet = 'Narwhal';
```

But what if I want a different pet? No problem—I can point pet to another value:
```
pet = 'The Kraken';
```

[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1666258306/video_to_markdown/images/video--c1b7543b36aaf6c99d1f92efcd822b99-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/video/upload/f_auto/just-javascript-email-images/jj03/kraken-reassignment-mp4.mp4 "")

All I am doing here is instructing JavaScript to point the variable, or a “wire”, on the left side (pet) to the value on the right side ('The Kraken'). It will keep pointing at that value unless I reassign it again later.

### Rules of Assignment
There are two rules when we want to use the = assignment operator:
- **The left side of an assignment must be a “wire”—such as the pet variable.** Note that the left side can’t be a value. (Try these examples in the console):
```
20000 = 'leagues under the sea'; // Nope.
'war' = 'peace'; // Nope.
```
- **The right side of an assignment must be an expression, so it always results in a value.** Our expression can be something simple, like 2 or 'hello'. It can also be a more complicated expression—for example:
```
pet = count + ' Dalmatians';
```
Here, count + ' Dalmatians' is an expression—a question to JavaScript. JavaScript will answer it with a value (for example, "101 Dalmatians"). From now on, the pet variable “wire” will point to that particular value.

**Fun Fact**

If the right side must be an expression, does this mean that simple things—numbers like 2 or strings like 'The Kraken'—written in code are also expressions? Yes! Such expressions are called literals—because we literally write down the values that they result in.

### Reading a Value of a Variable
I can also read the value of a variable—for example, to log it:
```
console.log(pet);
```
That’s hardly surprising.

But note that it is not the pet variable that we pass to console.log. We might say that colloquially, but we can’t really pass variables to functions. We pass the current value of the pet variable. How does this work?

It turns out that a variable name like pet can serve as an expression too! When we write pet, we’re asking JavaScript a question: “What is the current value of pet?” To answer our question, JavaScript follows pet “wire,” and gives us back the value at the end of this “wire.”

So the same expression can give us different values at different times!

### Nitpicking
Who cares if you say “pass a variable” or “pass a value”? Isn’t the difference hopelessly pedantic? I certainly don’t encourage interrupting your colleagues to correct them. That would be a waste of everyone’s time.

But you need to have clarity on what you can do with each JavaScript concept in your head. You can’t skate a bike. You can’t fly an avocado. You can’t sing a mosquito. And you can’t pass a variable—at least not in JavaScript.

Here’s a small example of why these details matter.
```
function double(x) {
  x = x * 2;
}

let money = 10;
double(money);
console.log(money); // ?
```
If we thought double(money) was passing a variable, we could expect that x = x * 2 would double the money variable.

But that’s not right: double(money) means “figure out the value of money, and then pass that value to double.” So money still points to 10. What a scam!

What are the different JavaScript concepts in your head? How do they relate to each other and how can we interact with them from code?

Write down a short list of the ones you use most often.

## Putting it Together
Now let’s revisit the first example from Mental Models:
```
let x = 10;
let y = x;
x = 0;
```
I suggest that you take a piece of paper or a [drawing app](https://excalidraw.com/) and sketch out a diagram of what happens to the “wires” of the x and y variables step by step.

You can do the sketch right here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42236890/196914445-9d32e20f-fdee-49c3-ae8c-8ce6cacfd8d0.png)

[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1666266591/video_to_markdown/images/video--88b5526ded9181af18222207bf9a1d51-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/video/upload/f_auto/just-javascript-email-images/jj03/assign-step1-mp4.mp4 "")

The first line doesn’t do much:
- Declare a variable called x.
  - Draw the x variable wire.
- Assign to x the value of 10.
  - Point the x wire to the value 10.

[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1666266672/video_to_markdown/images/video--ced12f1eb840b5622d7ecf28673efe8e-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/video/upload/f_auto/just-javascript-email-images/jj03/assign-step2-mp4.mp4 "")

The second line is short, but it does quite a few things:

- Declare a variable called y.
  - Draw the y variable wire.
- Assign to y the value of x.
  - Evaluate the expression: x.
    - The “question” we want to answer is x.
    - Follow the x wire—the answer is the value 10.
  - The x expression resulted in the value 10.
  - Therefore, assign to y the value of 10.
  - Point the y wire to the value 10.

Finally, we get to the third line:

[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1666266756/video_to_markdown/images/video--9d5164b4868ac1da900e0e276f846d58-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/video/upload/f_auto/just-javascript-email-images/jj03/assign-step3-mp4.mp4 "")

- Assign to x the value of 0.
  - Point the x wire to the value 0.

After these three lines of code have run, the x variable points to the value 0, and the y variable points to the value 10.

**Note that y = x did not mean point y to x. We can’t point variables to each other! Variables always point to values.** When we see an assignment, we “ask” the right side’s value, and point the “wire” on the left side to that value.

I mentioned in Mental Models that it is common to think of variables as boxes. The universe we’re building is not going to have any boxes at all. It only has wires!

This might seem a bit annoying, but using wires makes it much easier to explain numerous other concepts, like strict equality, object identity, and mutation. We’re going to stick with wires, so you might as well start getting used to them now!

Our universe is full of wires.

## Recap
- **Primitive values are immutable.** They’re a permanent part of our JavaScript universe—we can’t create, destroy, or change them. For example, we can’t set a property on a string value because it is a primitive value. Arrays are not primitive, so we can set their properties.

- **Variables are not values.** Each variable points to a particular value. We can change which value it points to by using the = assignment operator.

- **Variables are like wires.** A “wire” is not a JavaScript concept—but it helps us imagine how variables point to values. When we do an assignment, there’s always a wire on the left, and an expression (resulting in a value) on the right.

- **Look out for contradictions.** If two things that you learned seem to contradict each other, don’t get discouraged. Usually it’s a sign that there’s a deeper truth lurking underneath.

- **Language matters.** We’re building a mental model so that we can be confident in what can or cannot happen in our universe. We might speak about these ideas in a casual way (and nitpicking is often counterproductive) but our understanding of the meaning behind the terms needs to be precise.

## Exercises
This module also has exercises for you to practice!

**Don’t skip them!**

Even though you’re likely familiar with the concept of variables, these exercises will help you cement the mental model we’re building. We need this foundation before we can get to more complex topics.

# Take a Quiz
## 1.A Type Switcheroo
### Question
Is this code valid?
```
let numberOfTentacles = 10;
numberOfTentacles = 'eight';
console.log(typeof numberOfTentacles);
```
**If it’s valid, what does it print? If not, what exactly is wrong with it?**

Explain your thinking.

### My Answer
string

### Standard Answer
**Yes, it’s valid. It prints "string" to the console.**

Variables don’t have types in JavaScript — only values do. The answer to **typeof(numberOfTentacles)** depends on **which value** the variable was pointing to when we checked the type.

The numberOfTentacles variable was pointing to the "eight" string value when we checked its type. So we got "string" as a result.

Note that typeof numberOfTentacles is equivalent to typeof(numberOfTentacles) because the expression inside is simple enough. You don’t have to write the parens.

## 2.Shuffle It Up
### Question
Here's a slightly different example. What happens if you run it?
```
let numberOfTentacles = 10;
console.log(typeof numberOfTentacles);
numberOfTentacles = 'eight';
```
Is there a difference in the behavior compared to the last snippet? Does it error, or print something? This time, try to **use our mental model** in your explanation.

### My Answer
typeof 时 numberOfTentacles 指向的值的类型是 number

### Standard Answer
**Yes, there is a difference. It prints "number" to the console.**

Variables don’t have types in JavaScript — only values do. The answer to typeof(numberOfTentacles) depends on which value the variable was pointing to when we checked the type.

The numberOfTentacles variable was pointing to the 10 number value at the time we asked about its type. So we got "number" as a result.

Remember that you can’t answer a question by reading the code from the middle. To understand what happens, you have to always start at the beginning, and read one line at a time.

## 3.Meddling with Truth
### Question
What happens if we run this code?
```
let answer = true;
answer.opposite = false;
console.log(answer.opposite);
```
Explain why **using our mental model.**

### My Answer
undefined，不能为原始值设置属性

### Standard Answer
**This code won’t be able to set a property.**

Booleans are primitive. All primitive values are immutable. We can’t change them — and setting a property is a change.

If our code runs in the [strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), setting a property on a primitive value will error. Otherwise, the assignment is ignored.

In either case, we can’t set a property on a boolean like true.

## 4.Brave New Null
### Question
What happens if we run this code?
```
null = 10;
console.log(null);
```
Explain why **using our mental model.**

### Standard Answer
**This code produces an error.**

It is an error because **the left side of the assignment must always be a “wire”.** Variables are “wires”, so they can appear on the left side. A literal like null is not a “wire”, so trying to assign something to it is meaningless.

## 5.Let Them Eat Cake
### Question
Sketch a diagram of variables and values after this snippet of code runs:
```
let it = 'be';
let them = 'eat cake';
it = them;
```
**Use our mental model!**

### Standard Answer
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42236890/196946334-4e6be0fe-e67c-4242-aa79-23e959a52798.png)

## 6.Could It Have Changed?!
### Question
The feed function is written by your colleague in a different file:
```
import feed from './feed.js';

let pets = 'Tom and Jerry';
feed(pets);
console.log(pets[0]);
```
This code prints "T" to the console because it’s the first letter of pets.

Your colleague bets they can change your console.log output by only editing their feed.js file. Do you believe them, or would you bet they can’t?

Explain your reasoning using your mental model.

### My Answer
实现不了，向feed函数中传递的是pets指向的值（不太准确）

### Standard Answer
**Your colleague will probably lose their bet.**

This is because you can’t “pass a variable” in JavaScript, **you can only pass a value.** So it’s not the pets variable that we’re passing to feed. Rather, it’s the value of that variable at that time, which is the "Tom and Jerry" string value.

Since strings are immutable, there’s nothing the feed function could do to change that string. And since the pets variable itself is not being passed anywhere—only its current value is!—we know that feed could not change pets either.

There is still, however, a slim chance that your colleague would win the bet. For example, they could do this in feed.js:
```
export function feed(pets) {
  // Overwrite console.log with a fake implementation
  // so that you call it when you try to log "T"!
  let realLog = console.log;
  console.log = function(message) {
    realLog('You got pranked!');
  };
}
```
Now, when you call console.log, you will call their function that ignores your message and prints something else. Or they could throw an error, preventing your code from running at all.

Still, unless your colleague is a seasoned prankster, they will probably lose their bet.

## 7.Could It Have Changed?! Part 2
### Question
Imagine the same situation, but pets pointed to an array instead of a string:
```
import feed from './feed.js';

let pets = ['Tom', 'Jerry'];
feed(pets);
console.log(pets[0]);
```
This code prints "Tom" to the console.

Once again, your colleague bets they can change the output by only editing their feed.js file. Do you believe them, or would you bet they can’t?

### My Answer
可以，数组的值可变。

### Standard Answer
**Your colleague will very easily win their bet.**

You can’t “pass a variable” in JavaScript, you can only pass a value. So it’s not the pets variable that we’re passing to feed. Rather, it’s the value of that variable at that time, which is the array whose elements include "Tom" and "Jerry".

However, unlike strings, arrays are mutable! This means that your colleague can add, change, or remove items in the array that we passed into their function, without any trouble:
```
export function feed(pets) {
  pets[0] = 'Pikachu';
}
```
Note that despite also being called pets, the pets argument in the feed function has nothing to do with the pets variable in your code. They are two different “wires”. However, they both point to the same array, which is why changing it in one place will cause your code to read a different value from it.

**Whenever you pass a mutable value, someone can mess it up!**

We’ll revisit this idea in much more detail in a later module.
