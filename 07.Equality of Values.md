# Read Episode
It’s time to talk about equality in JavaScript! Here’s why it matters.

Imagine attending a masked carnival with only a few types of masks to choose from. Groups of people with the exact same outfit would be joking, dancing, and moving around the room. It would be confusing! You might talk to two people, and not realize that you really talked to the same person twice. Or you might think you talked to one person when, in reality, you talked to two different people!

**If you don’t have a clear mental model of equality in JavaScript, every day is like a carnival—and not in a good way.** You’re never quite sure if you’re dealing with the same value, or with two different values. As a result, you’ll often make mistakes—like changing a value you didn’t intend to change.

Luckily, we’ve already done most of the work to establish the concept of equality in JavaScript. It fits into our mental model in a very natural way.

## Kinds of Equality
In JavaScript, there are several kinds of equality. If you’ve been writing JavaScript for a while, you’re probably familiar with at least two of them:

- **Strict Equality:** a === b (triple equals).
- **Loose Equality:** a == b (double equals).
- **Same Value Equality:** Object.is(a, b).


Most tutorials don’t mention same value equality at all. We’ll take a road less traveled, and explain it first. We can then use it to explain the other kinds of equality.

### Same Value Equality: Object.is(a, b)
In JavaScript, Object.is(a, b) tells us if a and b are the same value:
```
console.log(Object.is(2, 2)); // true
console.log(Object.is({}, {})); // false
```
This is called **same value equality.**

**Fun Fact**

Despite Object in the method name, Object.is is not specific to objects. It can compare any two values, whether they are objects or not!

What does “same value” mean, exactly, in our mental model? You might already know this intuitively, but let’s verify your understanding.

### Check Your Intuition
Consider this example from our earlier exercises:
```
let dwarves = 7;
let continents = '7';
let worldWonders = 3 + 4;
```
As a reminder, our sketch for this snippet looked like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42236890/197323782-48a9a457-2cd1-4736-9fe5-1739459d9fcf.png)

**Now try to answer these questions using the diagram above:**
```
console.log(Object.is(dwarves, continents)); // ?
console.log(Object.is(continents, worldWonders)); // ?
console.log(Object.is(worldWonders, dwarves)); // ?
```
Write down your answers and think about how you would explain them.

**Answer**
This was not a trick question! Here are the answers:

- Object.is(dwarves, continents) is false because dwarves and continents point to different values.

- Object.is(continents, worldWonders) is false because continents and worldWonders point to different values.

- Object.is(worldWonders, dwarves) is true because worldWonders and dwarves point to the same value.

If two values are represented by a single shape on our diagram, it means that they aren’t really two different values. They are the same value! In those instances, Object.is(a, b) returns true.

In the previous module, we explored the types of values in our JavaScript universe. As we got to know these values, we were learning what makes them distinct from one another. As a result, we also learned the opposite—what it means for values to be the same.

If you struggle with this idea, you might want to revisit our celestial tour of values and work through the exercises again. It will make sense, I promise!

### But What About Objects?
By this point, you might be worried about objects. You might have heard that equality doesn’t work with objects, or that it compares “references.” **If you have existing intuitions like these, set them aside completely for a moment.**

Instead, look at this code snippet:
```
let banana = {};
let cherry = banana;
let chocolate = cherry;
cherry = {};
```
Open a notepad or use the sketchpad below and draw a diagram of variables and values. You’ll want to draw it step by step, as it’s hard to do in your head.

Remember that {} always means “create a new object value.” Also, remember that = means “point the wire on the left side to the value on the right side.”

After you finish drawing, write down your answers to these questions:
```
console.log(Object.is(banana, cherry)); // ?
console.log(Object.is(cherry, chocolate)); // ?
console.log(Object.is(chocolate, banana)); // ?
```
Make sure to use your diagram to answer them.

**Answer**
1. let banana = {};
    - Declare a banana variable.
    - Create a new object value {}.
    - Point the banana wire to it.
2. let cherry = banana;
   - Declare a cherry variable.
   - Point the cherry wire to where banana is pointing.
3. let chocolate = cherry;
   - Then, we declare a chocolate variable.
   - Point the chocolate wire to where cherry is pointing.
4. cherry = {};
   - Create a new object value {}.
   - Point the cherry wire to it.

After the last step, your diagram should look like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42236890/197324041-61565652-b292-4749-bea9-cbe6193c7cb1.png)

Now let’s check your answers:

1. Object.is(banana, cherry) is false because banana and cherry point to different values.

2. Object.is(cherry, chocolate) is false because cherry and chocolate point to different values.

3. Object.is(chocolate, banana) is true because chocolate and banana point to the same value.

As you can see, we didn’t need any additional concepts to explain how **same value equality** works for objects. It comes naturally using our mental model. And that’s all there is to know about it!

## Strict Equality: a === b
You have probably used the strict equality operator before:
```
console.log(2 === 2); // true
console.log({} === {}); // false
```
There is also a corresponding opposite !== operator.

### Same Value Equality vs. Strict Equality
So what’s the difference between Object.is and ===?

Same value equality—Object.is(a, b)—has a direct meaning in our mental model. It corresponds to the idea of “the same value” in our universe.

In almost all cases, the same intuition works for strict value equality. For example, 2 === 2 is true because 2 always “summons” the same value:

[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1666420297/video_to_markdown/images/video--57bf59054cc77b708874fffae92716f7-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/video/upload/f_auto/just-javascript-email-images/jj06/equality_small-mp4.mp4 "")

Conversely, {} === {} is false because each {} creates a different value:

[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1666420325/video_to_markdown/images/video--ed34a1cddc32600c1b5562cff4c02563-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/video/upload/f_auto/just-javascript-email-images/jj06/inequality_small-mp4.mp4 "")

In the above examples, a === b behaves the same way as Object.is(a, b). However, there are **two rare cases** where the behavior of === is different.

Remember memorizing irregular verbs when you were learning English? The cases below are similar—**consider them as exceptions to the rule.**

Both of these unusual cases involve “special numbers” we discussed in the past:

1. NaN === NaN is false, although they are the same value.
2. -0 === 0 and 0 === -0 are true, although they are different values.

These cases are uncommon, but we’ll still take a closer look at them.

### First Special Case: NaN
As we saw in our celestial tour of values, NaN is a special number that shows up when we do invalid math like 0 / 0:
```
let width = 0 / 0; // NaN
```
Further calculations with NaN will give you NaN again:
```
let height = width * 2; // NaN
```
You probably won’t do this intentionally, but it can happen if there is a flaw in your data or calculations.

**Remember that NaN === NaN is always false:**
```
console.log(width === height); // false
```
However, NaN is the same value as NaN:
```
console.log(Object.is(width, height)); // true
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42236890/197324289-eb2c68b3-2004-469c-9a16-10873833f895.png)

That’s confusing.

The reason for NaN === NaN being false is largely historical, so I suggest accepting it as a fact of life. You might run into this if you try to write some code that checks a value for being NaN (for example, to print a warning).
```
function resizeImage(size) {
  if (size === NaN) {
    // This will never get logged: the check is always false!
    console.log('Something is wrong.');
  }
  // ...
}
```
Instead, here are a few ways (they all work!) to check if size is NaN:
- Number.isNaN(size)
- Object.is(size, NaN)
- size !== size

The last one might be particularly surprising. Give it a few moments. If you don’t see how it detects NaN, try re-reading this section and thinking about it again.

**Answer**

size !== size works because NaN === NaN is false, as we already learned. So the reverse (NaN !== NaN) must be true.

Since NaN is the only value that’s not Strict Equal to itself, size !== size can only mean that size is NaN.

**Fun Fact**

A quick historical anecdote: ensuring developers could detect NaN this way was one of the original reasons for making NaN === NaN return false! This was decided before JavaScript even existed.

### Second Special Case: -0
In regular math, there is no such concept as “minus zero,” but it exists in floating-point math for practical reasons. Here’s an interesting fact about it.

Both 0 === -0 and -0 === 0 are always true:
```
let width = 0; // 0
let height = -width; // -0
console.log(width === height); // true
```
However, 0 is a different value from -0:
```
console.log(Object.is(width, height)); // false
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42236890/197324393-997b8dea-0961-479a-a5d1-68a157073968.png)

That’s confusing too.

In practice, I haven’t run into a case where this matters in my entire career.

### Coding Exercise
Now that you know how Object.is and === work, I have a small coding exercise for you. You don’t have to complete it, but it’s a fun brainteaser.

Write a function called strictEquals(a, b) that returns the same value as a === b. Your implementation must not use the === or !== operators.

Here is my answer if you want to check yourself. This function is utterly useless, but writing it helps make sense of ===.

### Don’t Panic
Hearing about these special numbers and how they behave can be overwhelming. Don’t stress too much about these special cases!

They’re not very common. Now that you know they exist, you will recognize them in practice. In most cases, we can trust our “equality intuition” for both Object.is(a, b) and a === b.

## Loose Equality
Finally, we get to the last kind of equality.

Loose equality (double equals) is the bogeyman of JavaScript. Here are a couple of examples to make your skin crawl:
```
console.log([[]] == ''); // true
console.log(true == [1]); // true
console.log(false == [0]); // true
```
[Wait, what?!](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/)

The rules of loose equality (also called “abstract equality”) are arcane and confusing. Many coding standards prohibit the use of == and != in code altogether.

Although Just JavaScript doesn’t take strong opinions on what features you should or shouldn’t use, we’re not going to cover loose equality in much detail. It’s uncommon in modern codebases, and its rules don’t play a larger role in the language—or in our mental model.

**Fun Fact**

The rules of loose equality are widely acknowledged as an early bad design decision of JavaScript, but if you are still curious, you can check out [how it works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#loose_equality_using) here. Don’t feel pressured to memorize it—you’ll need that memory for other topics!

The one relatively common use case worth knowing is:
```
if (x == null) {
  // ...
}
```
This code is equivalent to writing:
```
if (x === null || x === undefined) {
  // ...
}
```
However, even that usage of == might be controversial on some teams. It’s best to discuss how much == is tolerated in your codebase as a team before using it.

## Recap
- JavaScript has several kinds of equality. They include **same value equality**, **strict equality**, and **loose equality**.
- Same value equality, or Object.is(a, b), matches the concept of the sameness of values that we introduced in the previous module.
  - Understanding this kind of equality helps prevent bugs! You will often need to know when you’re dealing with the same value, and when you’re dealing with two different values.
  - When we draw a diagram of values and variables, the same value cannot appear twice. Object.is(a, b) is true when variables a and b point to the same value on our diagram.
  - Same value equality is verbose and a bit annoying to write, but it's also the easiest to explain, which is why we started with it.
- In practice, you will use strict equality, or a === b, most often. It is equivalent to the same value equality except for two rare special cases:
  - NaN === NaN is false, even though they are the same value.
  - 0 === -0 and -0 === 0 is true, but they are different values.
- You can check whether x is NaN using Number.isNaN(x).
- Loose equality (==) uses a set of arcane rules and is often avoided.

## 6.You Shall Not Pass
### Question
The author of this code expects it to print a message. Will the message appear?

Use our mental model to answer this. Make a sketch if you’d like!
```
let ticket = { id: 0 };
if (ticket === { id: 0 }) {
  console.log('Bad ticket');
}
```
### Standard Answer
No, the message will not appear.

When we “ask” ticket === { id: 0 }, we need to figure out what value is on each side of ===. On the left side, we have ticket, whose value is the object we created on the first line by writing { id: 0 }. On the right side, we have a { id: 0 } object literal — which also creates a completely new value!

We have different object values on each side of ===. So the check will not pass, and the function will not print our message.
```
let ticket = { id: 0 };
if (ticket === { id: 0 }) { // false
  console.log('Bad ticket'); // Will not run.
}
```
## 7. All Things Must Pass
### Question
The author of this code expects it to print a message. Will the message appear?

Use our mental model to answer this. Make a sketch if you’d like!
```
let ticketId = 0;
if (ticketId === 0) {
  console.log('Bad ticket');
}
```
### Standard Answer
Yes, the message will appear.

When we “ask” ticketId === 0, we need to figure out what value is on each side of ===. On the left side, we have ticketId, which points to the number value 0. On the right side, we have the 0 literal — which also results in the number value 0.

There is only one number value 0 in our universe, and we have that same value on both sides of ===. The check will pass, and the function will print our message.
```
let ticketId = 0;
if (ticketId === 0) { // true
  console.log('Bad ticket'); // Will run!
}
```
## 8.Twin Shadow
### Question
Can you think of a different value than 0 that would also cause a message to be printed?
```
let ticketId = ???;
if (ticketId === 0) {
  console.log('Bad ticket');
}
```
### Standard Answer
The other value that would cause the message to be printed is -0.

Even though 0 and -0 are two different values, === considers them equal.

## 9.Spill the Beans
### Question
Sketch a diagram of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

let matcha = tea();
let latte = coffee();
```
**Use our mental model.**

### Standard Answer
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42236890/197325187-c175b619-af44-47cc-a0c4-5e9a36eaef3f.png)

## 10
### Question
Now use this sketch to answer these questions:
1. tea === coffee
2. Object.is(tea, coffee)
3. matcha === latte
4. Object.is(matcha, latte)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42236890/197325225-bbe6d6ce-43ce-4a99-8ab1-63c587f961e0.png)

### Standard Answer
Only Object.is(matcha, latte) is true, all the other answers are false.

1. tea === coffee: This is false because tea and coffee point at two different function values.
2. Object.is(tea, coffee): This is false because tea and coffee point at two different function values.
3. matcha === latte: This is false because both of them point at NaN, and NaN === NaN is always false. (If you forgot about this, you can re-read the section about special cases of Strict Equality.)
4. Object.is(matcha, latte): This is true because matcha and latte point at the same NaN number value.
